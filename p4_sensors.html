		Experienced with <a href="file/Lab1.pdf">servo potentiometer</a> under different displacement angle to obtain the relationship
		 of output voltage and changing of angle, also completed error analysis. Worked with linear variable differential transformer, 
		recorded output voltages at different positions and plotted graph to show the relationship between voltage and displacement; </br>

		Calculated <a href="file/Lab3.pdf"> Poisson’s Ratio and Young's Modulus </a>for the aluminum bar by measuring the strains
		 with a provided professional Wheatstone bridge; </br>
		
		Constructed the circuit with a TSL2591 <a href="file/project.pdf">luminosity sensor</a> and recorded the output under different lighting condition from 
		Arduino microcontroller to measure the corresponding lux;</br>
